  "description": "Storage systems play a pivotal role in the digital landscape, acting as the backbone for data management, retrieval, and protection. The exponential growth of data generated by individuals and enterprises necessitates robust, scalable, and efficient storage solutions. Traditional storage systems, such as hard disk drives (HDDs), have evolved significantly, but the advent of solid-state drives (SSDs) has marked a substantial leap in terms of speed, reliability, and energy efficiency. SSDs, with their faster read/write capabilities and lower latency, have become essential for applications requiring high performance, such as databases, virtual machines, and real-time analytics.<br/><br/>The advances in storage technology extend beyond hardware improvements. Cloud storage has revolutionized data accessibility and management, offering scalable and flexible solutions that can accommodate the dynamic needs of businesses. Cloud providers offer a range of storage options, from object storage for unstructured data to block storage for databases and applications. These services not only provide vast amounts of storage space but also incorporate advanced features like automated backups, disaster recovery, and data encryption, enhancing data security and integrity.<br/> <br/>These innovations are crucial for supporting the growing demands of big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and Internet of Things (IoT) applications in storage systems, where data processing speed and efficiency are paramount. These advancements not only enhance performance and reliability but also enable new possibilities in data-driven innovation and digital transformation.<br/><br/>This online workshop, Recent Advances in SSD Research and Practice, aims to bring together leading researchers, engineers, and graduate students in the field of storage systems, and is jointly supported by the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE), and the Computer Society of Iran (CSI).",

          "content": "The exponential growth in data-intensive applications necessitates efficient data transfer and memory management strategies in modern GPU computing. This paper explores the potential of GPUDirect Storage (GDS) as a high-throughput solution for direct data transfers between storage and GPU memory, bypassing CPU involvement and reducing data movement overhead. We study the intricacies of memory management within the GPU memory hierarchy, highlighting the challenges and solutions for optimizing data access patterns. A central focus is placed on intelligent caching and data prefetching mechanisms to predict and pre-load data into appropriate memory tiers, thereby minimizing latency and maximizing computational throughput. By integrating GDS with advanced memory management strategies, we demonstrate significant improvements in performance for various data-intensive applications.",

          "topic": "The Design and Implementation of a High-Performance Log-Structured RAID System for ZNS SSDs",
          "content": "In this talk, I will make a case for showing how to achieve efficient reliable storage for the emerging ZNS SSDs. ZNS defines a new abstraction for host software to flexibly manage storage in flash-based SSDs as append-only zones.  It also provides a Zone Append primitive to further boost the write performance of ZNS SSDs by exploiting intra-zone parallelism. However, making Zone Append effective for RAID storage across multiple ZNS SSDs is non-trivial since Zone Append offloads address management to ZNS SSDs and requires hosts to dedicatedly manage RAID stripes across multiple drives. We propose ZapRAID, a high-performance log-structured RAID system for ZNS SSDs by carefully exploiting Zone Append to achieve high write parallelism and lightweight stripe management. ZapRAID adopts a group-based data layout with a coarse-grained ordering across multiple groups of stripes, such that it can use small-size metadata for stripe management on a per-group basis under Zone Append. It further adopts hybrid data management to simultaneously achieve intra-zone and inter-zone parallelism through a careful combination of both Zone Append and Zone Write primitives. Our evaluation shows that ZapRAID achieves high performance in various operations.  Finally, I will also discuss future research directions of applying ZNS SSDs to large-scale distributed storage. ",
